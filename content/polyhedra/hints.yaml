not-a-polygon-1: One of the sides of this shape is curved, so it’s not a polygon.
not-a-polygon-2: This shape is not a polygon, because it contains a hole.
not-a-polygon-3: This shape has a curved side, so it can’t be a polygon.

no-overlap: Careful – the sides are not allowed to cross, otherwise we no longer have a polygon.
angles-repeat: Great! Now try moving some of the vertices of the quadrilateral and see what happens.

not-a-diagonal: This is not a diagonal of the quadrilateral.
not-a-diagonal-1: This is not a diagonal of the parallelogram.

not-concave-1: "Triangles can never be concave: all their angles are less than 180°."
not-concave-2: This polygon is convex – all angles are less than 180°.
not-concave-3: This polygon is convex – all diagonals lie inside the polygon, and all angles are less than 180°.

not-regular-1: In this polygon, some sides have different lengths – therefore it can’t be regular.
not-regular-2: All of the sides have the same length, but some of the angles have different sizes. Therefore this is _not_ a regular polygon.
not-regular-3: This is a circle, not a polygon!

parall-error-1: That’s not true – the angles can have any size, as long as they add up to 360°.
parall-error-2: This is true if the parallelogram also happens to be a rhombus, but not for _any_ parallelogram.
parall-error-3: This is correct if the parallelogram happens to be a rectangle, but not for _any_ parallelogram.
parall-error-4: "No: adjacent sides in a parallelogram don’t have to have the same length."

move-polyhedra: "The [three-dimensional polyhedra](->#poly1) are interactive. Try rotating them!"
use-euler: Remember that you can use __Euler’s Formula__ to find the number of faces, vertices or edges.
