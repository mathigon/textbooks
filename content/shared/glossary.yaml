  title: Fermat’s Last Theorem
  text: |
    __Fermat’s Last Theorem__ states that the equation `x^n + y^n = z^n` has no
    integer solutions for `n>2`. If `n=2`, we get _Pythagoras’ theorem_ which
    has many integer solutions, but for _n_ = 3, 4, 5, … there are none.

    In 1637, the mathematician Pierre de Fermat made a note in a textbook,
    claiming that he had a proof, but that it was too large to fit in the
    margin. For over 350 years, other mathematicians tried to find this proof,
    and Fermat’s Last Theorem was even in the _Guinness Book of World Records_
    as the “most difficult mathematical problem”.

    In 1994, after many years of work, Andrew Wiles finally managed to prove it.
    He later received the Abel Prize, one of the highest honours in mathematics.

millennium-prize:
  title: Millennium Prize Problems
  text: |
    The seven __Millennium Prize Problems__ are some of the most difficult open
    problems in Mathematics. They were listed in 2000 by the _Clay Mathematics
    Institute_, and each hold a $1m reward:

    * P vs NP
    * The Hodge Conjecture
    * The Poincaré Conjecture
    * The Riemann Hypothesis
    * Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap
    * Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness
    * The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture

    So far, just one of the problems, the _Poincaré Conjecture_, was solved.
    However the mathematician who solved it, Grigori Perelman, declined the
    award.
