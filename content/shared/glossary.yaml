absolute-value:
  title: Absolute value
  text: The __absolute value__ of a number is its distance from 0 on the number
    line. It makes negative numbers positive, but leaves positive numbers
    unchanged. The absolute value of `x` is written as `|x|`. For example,
    `|-5| = 5` and `|3| = 3`.
  # The absolute value of a number is the distance between the number and the
  # origin. This connects the notion of _absolute value_ to the modulus of a
  # complex number and the magnitude of a vector.

acceleration:
  title: Acceleration
  text: Acceleration is change in velocity over time. In calculus, we understand
    acceleration to be the derivative of velocity. In everyday life, we typically

    All rational numbers (like `2/3`) and surds (like `root(3,5)`) are
    algebraic, and so are numbers that can be build from surds (like
    `(2 + sqrt(3))/(1 - sqrt(5))`.

    Those numbers which are real but _not_ algebraic are called _transcendental
    numbers_.

alternate-angles:
  title: Alternate angles
  text: |
    __Alternate angles__ are formed by two _parallel lines_ which are crossed
    by a _traversal_ line, and they are always congruent. In the diagram below,
    each of the pairs of angles labelled 1, 2, 3 and 4 are alternate. The two
    angles in every pair lie on a different parallel line, and opposite sides
    of the traversal.

    The angle pairs 1 and 2 are called __alternate exterior angles__, because
    they lie outside the parallel lines, and the angle pairs 3 and 4 are
    called __alternate interior angles__.

    Fibonacci.

arccos:
  title: Inverse cosine
  text: |
    The __inverse cosine__ function is a trigonometric function written as
    `arccos(x)` or `cos^(-1)(x)`. It is the inverse of `cos(x)`.
  # Basic idea: To find cos-1 (½), we ask "what angle has cosine equal to ½?" The
  # answer is 60°. As a result we say cos-1 (½) = 60°. In radians this is
  # cos-1(½) = π/3. There are actually many angles that have cosine equal to ½.
  # We are really asking "what is the simplest, most basic angle that has
  # cosine equal to ½?" As before, the answer is 60°. Thus cos-1 (½) = 60° or
  # cos-1 (½) = π/3. Details: What is cos-1 (–½)? Do we choose 120°, –120°, 240°,
  # or some other angle? The answer is 120°. With inverse cosine, we select the
  # angle on the top half of the unit circle. Thus cos-1 (–½) = 120° or
  # cos-1 (–½) = 2π/3. In other words, the range of cos-1 is
  # restricted to [0, 180°] or [0, π].

    has many integer solutions, but for _n_ = 3, 4, 5, … there are none.

    In 1637, the mathematician Pierre de Fermat made a note in a textbook,
    claiming that he had a proof, but that it was too large to fit in the
    margin. For over 350 years, other mathematicians tried to find this proof,
    and Fermat’s last theorem was even in the _Guinness Book of World Records_
    as the “most difficult mathematical problem”.

    In 1994, after many years of work, Andrew Wiles finally managed to prove it.
    He later received the Abel Prize, one of the highest honours in mathematics.
