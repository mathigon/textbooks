  name: Abel
  full: Niels Henrik Abel
  bio: |
    __Niels Henrik Abel__ (1802 – 1829) was an important Norwegian
    mathematician. Even though he died at the age of 26, he made groundbreaking
    contributions to a wide range of topics.

    At the age of 16, Abel proved the binomial theorem. Three years later, he
    proved that it is impossible to solve quintic equations – by independently
    inventing group theory. This had been an open problem for over 350 years! He
    also worked on elliptic functions and discovered _Abelian_ functions.

    Abel spent his life in poverty: he had six siblings, his father died when he
    was 18, he was unable to find a job at a university, and many mathematicians
    initially dismissed his work. Today, one of the highest awards in
    mathematics, the _Abel Prize_ is named after him.

  bio: |
    __Maria Gaetana Agnesi__ (1718 – 1799) was an Italian mathematician,
    philosopher, theologian, and humanitarian.  Agnesi was the first western
    woman to write a mathematics textbook. She was also the first woman to be
    appointed professor at a university.

    Her textbook, the _Analytical Institutions for the use of Italian youth_
    combined differential and integral caluclus, and was an international
    success.

    Agnesi also studied a bell-shaped curve described by the equation
    `y=a^3/(x^2+a^2)`. This function is now called the _Witch of Agnesi_. The
    strange name might come from a pun in the Italian language, were the word
    “versiera” for “witch” sounds similar to the ropes used when sailing.

    __Hasan Ibn al-Haytham__ (أبو علي، الحسن بن الحسن بن الهيثم, c. 965 – 1050)
    lived in Cairo during the Islamic Golden Age, and studied mathematics,
    physics, astronomy, philosophy, and medicine. He was a proponent of the
    _scientific method_: the belief that any scientific hypothesis must be
    verified using experiments or mathematical logic – centuries before
    European scientists during the Renaissance.

    Al-Haytham was particularly interested in optics and visual perception. He
    also derived a formula for the sum of fourth powers (`1^4 + 2^4 + 3^4 + … +
    n^4`), and he studied the link between algebra and geometry.

    Baghdad. He worked at the “House of Wisdom”, which contained the first large
    collection of academic books since the destruction of the Library of
    Alexandria.

    Al-Khwarizmi has been called the “Father of algebra” – in fact, the word
    _algebra_ comes from the Arabic title of his most important book: “The
    Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing”. In it, he
    showed how to solve linear and quadratic equations, and for many centuries,
    it was the main mathematics textbook at European universities.

    Al-Khwarizmi also worked in astronomy and geography, and the word
    “algorithm” is named after him.

    __Archimedes__ (c. 287 – 212 BCE) was an ancient Greek scientist and
    engineer, and one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. He discovered
    many concepts of calculus and worked in geometry, analysis and mechanics.

    While taking a bath, Archimedes discovered a way to determine the volume of
    irregular objects using the amount of water they displaced when submerged.
    He was so excited by this discovery that he ran out on the street, still
    undressed, yelling _“Eureka!”_ (Greek for _“I have found it!”_).

    As an engineer, he built ingenious defence machines during the siege of his
    home city Syracuse in Sicily. After two years, the Romans finally managed to
    enter, and Archimedes was killed. His last words were _“Do not disturb my
    circles”_ – which he was studying at the time.

    __Charles Babbage__ (1791 – 1871) was a British mathematician, philosopher
    and engineer. He is often called the “father of the computer”, having
    invented the first mechanical computer (the _Difference engine_), and an
    improved, programmable version (the _Analytical Engine_).

    In theory, these machines could automatically perform certain calculations
    stored on cards or tape. However, due to the high production costs, they
    were never fully completed during Babbage’s lifetime. In 1991, a functional
    replica was constructed at the Science Museum in London.

    __Jacob Bernoulli__ (1655 – 1705) was a Swiss mathematician, and one of the
    many important scientists in the Bernoulli family. In fact, he had a deep
    academic rivalry with several of his brothers and sons.

    Bernoulli made significant advances to the calculus that was invented by
    Newton and Leibnitz, created the field of _calculus of variations_,
    discovered the fundamental constant _e_, developed techniques for solving
    differential equations, and much more.

    He published the first substantial work about probability, including
    permutations, combinations and the law of large numbers, he proved the
    binomial theorem, and derived many of the properties of Bernoulli numbers.

    __Daniel Bernoulli__ (1700 – 1782) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist.
    He was one of the many famous scientists from the Bernoulli family –
    including his father Johann, his uncle Jacob, and his brother Nicholas.

    Daniel Bernoulli showed that as the speed of a fluid increases, its pressure
    decreases. Now called _Bernoulli’s principle_, this is the mechanism used by
    airplane wings and combustion engines. He also made important discoveries
    in probability and statistics, and first encountered _Bessel functions_.

    At the age of 34, he was banned from his father’s house for beating him at
    an award from the Paris Academy, for which they both submitted an entry.

    he taught himself Latin, Greek and mathematics, hoping to escape his lower
    class life. He created _Boolean algebra_, which uses operators like AND, OR
    and NOT (rather than addition or multiplication) and can be used when
    working with sets. This was the foundation for formal mathematical logic,
    and has many applications in computer science.

  name: Cantor
  full: Georg Cantor
  bio: |
    The German mathematician __Georg Cantor__ (1845 – 1918) was the inventor of
    set theory, and a pioneer in our understanding of infinity. For most of his
    life, Cantor's discoveries were fiercely opposed by his colleagues. This may
    have contributed to his depression and nervous breakdowns, and he spent many
    decades in a mental institution.

    Cantor proved that there are _different sizes_ of infinity. The set of real
    numbers, for example, is _uncountable_ – meaning that it cannot be paired up
    with the set of natural numbers.

    Only towards the end of his life, Cantor started to receive the recognition
    he deserved. David Hilbert famously declared that “No one shall expel us
    from the paradise that Cantor has created”.

    cubic and quartic equations, was the first European to systematically use
    negative numbers, and even acknowledged the existence of imaginary numbers
    (based on `sqrt(-1)`).

    Cardano also made some early progress in probability theory and introduced
    binomial coefficients and binomial theorem to Europe. He invented many
    mechanical devices, including combination locks, gyroscopes with three
    degrees of freedom, and drive shafts (or Cardan shafts) that are still used

    affair with the philosopher _Voltaire_.

    She applied her mathematical ability while gambling, and used her winnings
    to buy books and laboratory equipment, and made important advanced regarding
    the concepts like energy and energy conservation.

    Around the age of 42, Du Châtelet became pregnant again. At the time,
    without adequate healthcare, this was very dangerous for women of her age.
    She was also working on a French translation of Newton’s book _Principia_,
    which containes the basic laws of physics.

    Du Châtelet was determined to finish the translation, as well as a detailed

    _Geocentric_ model of the universe, with Earth at the centre and
    everything else rotating around it.

    Copernicus created a new model, where the sun is at the centre, and Earth
    moves around it on a circle. He also predicted that Earth rotates around its
    axis once every day. Afraid that it would upset the Catholic church, he
    only published the model just before his death – triggering what is now
    called the _Copernican Revolution_.

    Copernicus also worked as a diplomat and physician, and made important

    of Venus, sunspots, and much more.

    Galileo, sometimes called the “father of modern science”, also studied the
    motion of objects in free fall, kinematics, material science, and invented
    the thermoscope (an early thermometer).

    He was a vocal proponent of _Heliocentrism_, the idea that the Sun was at

    The French mathematician __Évariste Galois__ (1811 – 1832) had a short and
    tragic life, yet he invented two entirely new fields of mathematics: _Group
    theory_ and _Galois theory_.

    While still in his teens, Galois proved that there is no general solution
    for polynomial equations of degree five or higher – simultaneously with
    Niels Abel.

    Unfortunately, other mathematicians who he shared these discoveries with
    repeatedly misplaced or simply returned his work, and he failed his school
    and university exams while concentrating on much more complex work.

    At the age of 21, Galois was shot in a duel (some say a feud over a woman),
    and later died of his wounds. During the night before his death, he
    summarised his mathematical discoveries in a letter to a friend. It would
    take other mathematicians many years to fully understand these letters, and
    realise the impact of his work.

    At the age of 25, just after finishing his doctorate in Vienna, he published
    his two _incompleteness theorems_. These state that any (consistent and
    sufficiently powerful) mathematical system contains certain statements that
    are true but cannot be proven. In other words, mathematics contains certain
    problems that are impossible to solve.

    This result had a profound impact on the development and philosophy of
    mathematics. Gödel also found an example of these “impossible theorems”:
    the _continuum hypothesis_.

  bio: |
    __Thales of Miletus__ (c. 624 – 546 BCE) was a Greek mathematician and
    philosopher.

    Thales is often recognised as the first scientist in Western civilisation:
    rather than using religion or mythology, he tried to explain natural
    phenomena using a scientific approach. He is also the first individual in
    history that has a mathematical discovery named after him: Thales’ theorem.

    blackjack player, known for inventing _card counting_ and for building the
    first _wearable computer_ to beat casinos at Roulette. He worked at MIT, is
    a professor of mathematics, and pioneered modern applications of probability
    theory.

turing:
  born: 1912
  died: 1954
  name: Turing
  full: Alan Turing
  bio: |
    __Alan Turing__ (1912 – 1954) was an English mathematician and is often
    called the “father of computer science”.

    During the Second World War, Turing played a critical role in breaking the
    Enigma code used by the German military, as part of the “Government Code and
    Cypher School” at Bletchley Park. This helped the Allies win the war, and
    may have saved millions of lives.

    He also invented the _Turing machine_, a mathematical model of a general
    purpose computer, and the _Turing test_, which can be used to judge the
    ability of artificial intelligence.

    Turing was gay, which was still a crime during his life, and meant that his
    groundbreaking accomplishments were never fully recognised. He committed
    suicide at the age of 41.

wiles:
  born: 1953
  name: Wiles

  bio: |
    The British mathematician __Sir Andrew Wiles__ (born 1953) is best known for
    proving Fermat’s Last Theorem, which, until then, was one of the most famous
    unsolved problems in mathematics.

    In 1637, Pierre de Fermat, wrote in the margin of a textbook that he had a
    wonderful proof that the equation `a^n + b^n = c^n` has no integer
    solutions for `n > 2`. Unfortunately, no one was able to find a proof –
    until Wiles, some 400 years later.

    Wiles had been fascinated by the problem since the age of 10, and spent
    seven years working on it in solitude. He announced his solution in 1993,
    although a small gap in his argument took two more years to fix.

    He was too old to receive the _Fields medal_, the highest award in
    mathematics, which has an age limit of 40. Instead, Wiles was awarded a
    special silver plaque for his work.
