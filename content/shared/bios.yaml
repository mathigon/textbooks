abel:
  born: 1802
  died: 1829
  name: Abel

  small: true
  bio: |
    __Niels Henrik Abel__ (1802 – 1829) was an important Norwegian
    mathematician. Even though he died at the age of 26, he made groundbreaking
    contributions to a wide range of topics.

    At the age of 16, Abel proved the binomial theorem. Three years later, he
    proved that it is impossible to solve quintic equations – by independently
    inventing group theory. This had been an open problem for over 350 years! He
    also worked on elliptic functions and discovered _Abelian_ functions.

    Abel spent his life in poverty: he had six siblings, his father died when he
    was 18, he was unable to find a job at a university, and many mathematicians
    initially dismissed his work. Today, one of the highest awards in
    mathematics, the _Abel Prize_ is named after him.

  name: Al-Khwarizmi
  overflow: true
  bio: |
    The Persian mathematician __Muhammad Al-Khwarizmi__ (محمد بن موسى الخوارزمي‎,
    780 – 850) lived during the golden age of the Muslim Abbasid regime in
    Baghdad. He worked at the “House of Wisdom”, which contained the first large
    collection of academic books since the destruction of the Library of
    Alexandria.

    Al-Khwarizmi has been called the “father of algebra” – in fact, the word
    _algebra_ comes from the Arabic title of his most important book: “The
    Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing”. In it, he
    showed how to solve linear and quadratic equations, and for many centuries,
    it was the main mathematics textbook at European universities.

    Al-Khwarizmi also worked in astronomy and geography, and the word
    “algorithm” is named after him.

apollonius:

appel:
  name: Appel
  bio: |
    __Kenneth Appel__ (1932 – 2013) was an American mathematician, known for his
    proof of the Four Colour Theorem with Wolfgang Haken.

    In recognition, he and Haken received the Fulkerson Prize of the American
    Mathematical Society.

    Appel studied at Queens College, New York, and the University of Michigan.
    He taught at the University of Illinois, and the University of New
    Hampshire.

archimedes:
  name: Archimedes
  born: -287
  died: -212
  bio: |
    __Archimedes__ (c. 287 – c. 212 BC) was an ancient Greek scientist and
    engineer, and one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. He discovered
    many concepts of calculus, and worked in geometry, analysis and mechanics.

    While taking a bath, Archimedes discovered a way to determine the volume of
    irregular objects using the amount of water they displaced when submerged.
    He was so excited by this discovery that he ran out on the street, still
    undressed, yelling _“Eureka!”_ (Greek for _“I have found it!”_).

    As engineer he built ingenious defence machines during the siege of his home
    city Syracuse in Sicily. After two years, the Romans finally managed to
    enter and Archimedes as killed. His last words were _“Do not disturb my
    circles”_ – which he was studying at the time.

  bio: |
    __Aristotle__ (Ἀριστοτέλης) was a philosopher in Ancient Greece. Together
    with his teacher _Plato_, he is considered the “Father of Western
    Philosophy”. He was also the private tutor of Alexander the Great.

    Aristotle wrote about science, mathematics, philosophy, poetry, music,
    politics, rhetoric, linguistics, and many other subjects. His work was
    highly influential during the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, and his
    views on ethics and other philosophical questions are still being discussed
    today.

    Aristotle is also the first known person to formally study _logic_,
    including its applications in science and mathematics.

  name: Babbage
  small: true
  bio: |
    __Charles Babbage__ (1791 – 1871) was a British mathematician, philosopher
    and engineer. He is often called the “father of the computer”, having
    invented the first mechanical computer (the _Difference engine_), and an
    improved, programmable version (the _Analytical Engine_).

    In theory, these machines could automatically perform certain calculations
    stored on cards or tape. However, due to the high production costs, they
    were never fully completed during Babbage’s lifetime. In 1991, a functional
    replica was constructed at the Science Museum in London.

bernoulli-1:
  born: 1654
  died: 1705
  name: Bernoulli
  bio: |
    __Jacob Bernoulli__ (1655 – 1705) was a Swiss mathematician, and one of the
    many important scientists in the Bernoulli family. In fact, he had a deep
    academic rivalry with several of his brothers and sons.

    Jacob made significant advances to the calculus that was invented by Newton
    and Leibnitz, created the field of _calculus of variations_, discovered the
    fundamental constant _e_, developed techniques for solving differential
    equations, and much more.

    He published the first substantial work about probability, including
    permutations, combinations and the law of large numbers, he proved the
    binomial theorem, and derived many of the properties of Bernoulli numbers.

bernoulli-2:
  born: 1700
  died: 1782
  name: Bernoulli
  bio: |
    __Daniel Bernoulli__ (1700 – 1782) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist.
    He was one of the many famous scientists from the Bernoulli family –
    including his father Johann, his uncle Jacob, and his brother Nicholas.

    Daniel Bernoulli showed that as the speed of a fluid increases, its pressure
    decreases. Now called _Bernoulli’s principle_, this is the mechanism used by
    airplane wings and combustion engines. He also made important discoveries
    in probability and statistics, and first encountered _Bessel functions_.

    At the age of 34, he was banned from his father’s house for beating him at
    an award from the Paris Academy, for which they both submitted an entry.

bhaskara:
  born: 1114
  died: 1185
  name: Bhaskara
  bio: __Bhaskara II__ (1114 – 1185) was an Indian mathematician and astronomer.
    He discovered some of the basic concepts of calculus, more than 500 years
    before Leibnitz and Newton. Bhaskara also established that division by zero
    yields infinity, and solved various quadratic, cubic, quartic and
    Diophantine equations.

bolyai:

  name: Bolyai
  small: true
  bio: |
    __János Bolyai__ (1802 – 1860) was a Hungarian mathematician, and one of
    the founders of non-Euclidean geometry – a geometry in which Euclid’s fifth
    axiom about parallel lines does not hold. This was a significant
    breakthrough in mathematics. Unfortunately for Bolyai, the mathematicians
    Gauss and Lobachevsky discovered similar results at the same time, and
    received most of the credit.

  bio: The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (c. 598 – 668 AD) invented the rules
    for addition, subtraction and multiplication with zero and negative numbers.
    He was also an astronomer and made many other discoveries in mathematics.
    Unfortunately, his writings did not contain any proofs, so we don’t know
    how he derived his results.

cantor:
  born: 1845
  died: 1918
  name: Cantor
  small: true
  bio: |
    The German mathematician __Georg Cantor__ (1845 – 1918) was the inventor of
    set theory, and a pioneer in our understanding of infinity. For most of his
    life, Cantor's discoveries were fiercely opposed by his colleagues. This may
    have contributed to his depression and nervous breakdowns, and he spent many
    decades in a mental institution.

    Cantor proved that there are _different sizes_ of infinity. The set of real
    numbers, for example, is _uncountable_ – meaning that it cannot be paired up
    with the set of real numbers.

    Only towards the end of his life, Cantor started to receive the recognition
    he deserved. David Hilbert famously declared that “No one shall expel us
    from the paradise that Cantor has created”.

    __Augustin-Louis Cauchy__ (1789 – 1857) was a French mathematician and
    physicist. He contributed to a wide range of areas in mathematics, and
    dozens of theorems and named after him.

    Cauchy formalised calculus and analysis, by reformulating and proving
    results where previous mathematicians were much more careless and imprecise.
    He founded the field of _complex analysis_, studied permutation groups, and
    worked on optics, fluid dynamics and elasticity theory.

cavalieri:

    __Bonaventura Cavalieri__ (1598 – 1647) was an Italian mathematician and
    monk. He developed a precursor to infinitesimal calculus, and is remembered
    for Cavalieri’s principle to find the volume of solids in geometry.

    Cavalieri also worked optics and motion, introduction logarithms to Italy,
    and exchanged many letters with Galileo Galilei.

    Professor Emeritus at Princeton University.

    He is best known for inventing “Conway’s Game of Life”, a _cellular
    automaton_ with fascinating properties. He explored the underlying
    mathematics of everyday objects like knots and games, as well as
    contributing to group theory, number theory and many other areas of
    mathematics.

  bio: |
    __Nicolaus Copernicus__ (1473 – 1543) was a Polish mathematician,
    astronomer and lawyer. During his life, most people believed in the
    _Heliocentric_ model of the universe, with Earth at the centre and
    everything else rotating around it.

    Copernicus created a new model, where the sun is at the centre, and Earth
    moves around it on a circle. He also predicted that Earth rotates around its
    axis once every day. Afraid that it would upset the Catholic church, he
    only published the model just before his death – triggering what is now
    called the _Copernican Revolution_.

    Copernicus also worked as a diplomat and physician, and made important
    contributions to economist.

    __Abraham de Moivre__ (1667 – 1754) was a French mathematician who worked
    in probability and analytic geometry. He is most remembered for _de Moivre's
    formula_, which linkes trigonometry and complex numbers.

    De Moivre discovered the formula for the normal distribution in probability,
    and first conjectured the _central limit theorem_. He also found a
    non-recursive formula for Fibonacci numbers, linking them to the golden
    ratio `φ`.

  bio: __Richard Dedekind__ (1831 – 1916) was a German mathematician and one of
    the students of Gauss. He developed many concepts in set theory, and
    invented _Dedekind cuts_ as the formal definition of real numbers. He also
    gave the first definitions of _number fields_ and _rings_, two important
    constructs in abstract algebra.

democritus:

  name: Democritus
  bio: The Greek mathematician __Democritus__ (c. 460 – 370 BC), may be the
    first person to speculate that all matter was made up of tiny _atoms_ and
    is considered the “father of modern science”. He also made many discoveries
    in geometry, including the formula for the volume of prisms and cones.

descartes:
  born: 1596
  died: 1650
  name: Descartes
  bio: |
    __René Descartes__ (1596 – 1650) was a French mathematician and philosopher,
    and one of the key figures in the Scientific Revolution. He refused to
    accept the authority of previous philosophers, and one of his best-known
    quotes is “I think, therefore I am”.

    Descartes is the father of _analytical geometry_, which allows us to
    describe geometric shapes using algebra. This was one of the prerequisites,
    which allowed Newton and Leibnitz to invent _calculus_ a few decades later.

    He is credited with the first use of superscripts for powers or exponents,
    and the _cartesian coordinate system_ is named after him.

diophantus:
  born: 200
  died: 284
  name: Diophantus
  overflow: true
  bio: |
    __Diophantus__ was a Hellenistic mathematician who lived in Alexandria.
    Most of his works are about solving polynomial equations with several
    unknowns. These are now called _Diophantine equation_ and remain an
    important area of research today.

    It was while reading one of Diophantus’ books, many centuries later, that
    _Pierre de Fermat_ proposed one of these equations had no solution. This
    became known as “Fermat’s Last Theorem”, and was only solved in 1994.

dirac:
  name: Dirac
  bio: |
    __Paul Dirac__ (1898 – 1972) was an English theoretical physicist, who
    shared the 1933 Nobel Prize with Erwin Schrödinger. Dirac was one of the
    pioneers of Quantum Mechanics, formulated the famous _Dirac equation_ and
    first predicted the existence of antimatter.

    He taught at Cambridge University, before moving to America. Dirac was
    famously shy and, according to Einstein, _“balancing on the dizzying path
    between genius and madness”_.

eratosthenes:
  name: Eratosthenes
  born: -276
  died: -195
  bio: __Eratosthenes of Cyrene__ (c. 276 BC – 195 BC) was a Greek
    mathematician, geographer, astronomer, historian, and poet. He spent much
    of his life in Egypt, as head of the library of Alexandria.

    Among many other achievements, Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of
    the Earth, measured the tilt of the Earth’s axis of rotation, estimated the
    distance to the sun, and created some of the first maps of the world.

    He also invented the “Sieve of Eratosthenes”, an efficient way to
    calculate _prime numbers_.

    __Paul Erdős__ (1913 – 1996) was one of the most productive mathematicians
    in history. Born in Hungarian, he solved countless problems in graph theory,
    number theory, combinatorics, analysis, probability, and other parts of
    mathematics.

    During his life, Erdős published around 1,500 papers and collaborated with
    more than 500 other mathematicians. In fact, he spent most of his life
    living out of a suitcase, travelling to seminars, and visiting colleagues!

    __Leonhard Euler__ (1707 – 1783) was one the greatest mathematicians of all
    times. His work spans all areas of mathematics, and he wrote 80 volumes of
    research.

    Euler was born in Switzerland and studied in Basel, but lived most of his
    life in Berlin, Prussia, and St. Petersburg, Russia.

    Euler invented much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, and
    made important discoveries in calculus, analysis, graph theory, physics,
    astronomy, and many other topics.

    __Pierre de Fermat__ (1607 – 1665) was a French mathematician and lawyer. He
    was an early pioneer of calculus, as well as working in number theory,
    probability, geometry and optics.

    In 1637, he wrote a short note in the margin of one of his textbooks,
    claiming that the equation `a^n + b^n = c^n` has no integer solutions for
    `n > 2`, and that he had a “marvellous proof, which this margin is too
    narrow to contain”. This became known as _Fermat’s Last Theorem_, and one of
    the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics – until it was finally
    proven in 1994.

    Italian mathematician. He is best known for the number sequence named after
    him: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …

    Fibonacci is also responsible for popularising the Arabic numerals (0, 1, 2,
    3, 4, …) in Europe, which was still using Roman numerals (I, V, X, D, …) in

    __Joseph Fourier__ (1768 – 1830) was a French mathematician, and a friend
    and advisor of Napoleon. In addition to his mathematical research, he is
    also credited with the discovery of the greenhouse effect.

    While travelling to Egypt, Fourier became particularly fascinated with
    _heat_. He studied heat transfer and vibrations, and discovered that any
    periodic function can be written as an infinite sum of trigonometric
    functions: a _Fourier series_.

fuller:

  bio: __Richard Buckminster “Bucky” Fuller__ (1895 – 1983) was an American
    architect, designer and inventor. He is famous for constructing _geodesic

    _fullerenes_, were later named after him.

galileo:
  born: 1564
  died: 1642
  name: Galileo
  bio: |
    __Galileo Galilei__ (1564 – 1642) was an Italian astronomer, physicist and
    engineer. He used one of the first telescopes to make observations of the
    night sky, where he discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter, the phases
    of Venus, sunspots, and much more.

    Galileo, sometimes called the “father of modern science”, also studied the
    motion of objects in free fall, kinematics, material science, and invented
    the thermoscope (an early thermometer).

    He was a vocal proponent of _Heliocentrism_, the idea that the Sun was at
    the centre of our solar system. This eventually led to him being tried by
    the Catholic Inquisition: Galileo was forced to recant and spent the rest
    of his life under house arrest.

galois:
  born: 1811
  died: 1832
  name: Galois
  overflow: true
  bio: |
    The French mathematician __Évariste Galois__ (1811 – 1832) had a short and
    tragic life, yet he invented two entirely new fields of mathematics: _Group
    theory_ and _Galois theory_.

    While still in his teens, Galois proved that there is no general solution
    for polynomial equations of degree five or higher – simultaneously with
    Niels Abel.

    Unfortunately, other mathematicians who he shared these discoveries with
    repeatedly misplaced or simply returned his work, and he failed his school
    and university exams while concentrating on much more complex work.

    At the age of 21, Galois was shot in a duel (some say a feud over a woman),
    and later died of his wounds. In the night before his death, he summarised
    his mathematical discoveries in a letter to a friend. It would take other
    mathematicians many years to fully realise the true impact of his work.

    every field of mathematics, from algebra and number theory to statistics,
    calculus, geometry, geology and astronomy.

    According to legend, he corrected a mistake in his father‘s accounting at
    the age of 3, and found a way to quickly add up all integers from 1 to 1000
    at the age of 8. He made his first important discoveries while still a
    teenager, and later tutored many other famous mathematicians as Professor.

    __Marie-Sophie Germain__ (1776 – 1831) decided that we wanted to be a
    mathematician at the age of 13, after reading about Archimedes.
    Unfortunately, as a woman, she was faced with significant opposition.
    Her parents tried to prevent her from studying when she was young, and she
    never received a post at a university.

    Germain was a pioneer in understanding the mathematics of elastic surfaces,
    for which she won the grand prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences. She
    also made considerable progress in solving Fermat's Last Theorem, and
    regularly corresponded with Carl Friedrich Gauss.

    immigrated to America, and is considered one of the greatest logicians in
    history.

    At the age of 25, just after finishing his doctorate in Vienna, he published
    his two _incompleteness theorems_. These state that any (consistent and
    sufficiently powerful) mathematical system contains certain statements that
    are true but cannot be proven. In other words, mathematics contains certain
    problems that are impossible to solve.

    This result had a profound impact on the development and philosophy of
    mathematics. Gödel also found an example of these “impossible theorems”:
    the _continuum hypothesis_.

    electrical engineer, remembered as the “father of information theory”. He
    worked on cryptography, including codebreaking for national defence during
    World War II, but he was also interested in juggling, unicycling and chess.
    In his spare times, he built machines that could juggle or solve the Rubik’s
    Cube puzzle.

sikdar:
  name: Sikdar
  bio: __Radhanath Sikdar__ (1813 – 1870) was an Indian mathematician. He was
    the first to measure the height of Mount Everest, and to show that it is
    the tallest mountain on Earth.

singmaster:
  name: Singmaster
  bio: __David Singmaster__ (born 1939) is an American mathematician who is
    particularly well known for his mathematical puzzles and brain teasers. He
    was the first to come up with mathematical algorithms for analysing and
    solving the _Rubik’s Cube_.

tartaglia:
  born: 1499
  died: 1557
  name: Tartaglia
  bio: __Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia__ (1499 – 1557) was an Italian mathematician,
    engineer and bookkeeper. He published the first Italian translations of
    Archimedes and Euclid, found a formula for solving any cubic equation
    (including the first real application of complex numbers), and used
    mathematics to investigate the projectile motion of cannonballs.

thales:
  name: Thales
  born: -624
  died: -546
  bio: |
    __Thales of Miletus__ (c. 624 – 546 BC) was a Greek mathematician and
    philosopher.

    Thales is often recognised as the first scientist in Western civilisation:
    rather than using religion or mythology, he tried to explain natural
    phenomena using a scientific approach. He is also the first individual in
    history that has a mathematical discovery named after him: Thales’ theorem.

thorp:
  name: Thorp
  bio: __Edward Thorp__ (born 1932) is an American hedge fund manager and
    blackjack player, known for inventing _card counting_ and for building the
    first _wearable computer_ to beat casinos at Roulette. He worked at MIT, is
    a professor of mathematics, and pioneered modern applications of probability
    theory.

turing:
  born: 1912
  died: 1954
  name: Turing
  bio: |
    __Alan Turing__ (1912 – 1954) was an English mathematician and is often
    called the “father of computer science”.

    During the Second World War, Turing played a critical role in breaking the
    Enigma code used by the German military, as part of the “Government Code and
    Cypher School” at Bletchley Park. This helped the Allies win the war, and
    may have saved millions of lives.

    He also invented the _Turing machine_, a mathematical model of a general
    purpose computer, and the _Turing test_, which can be used to judge the
    ability of artificial intelligence.

    Turing was gay, which was still a crime during his life, and meant that his
    groundbreaking accomplishments were never fully recognised. He committed
    suicide at the age of 41.

ulam:
  name: Ulam
  bio: __Stanisław Ulam__ (1909 – 1984) was a Polish-American mathematician. He
    played an important part in the American _Manhatten Project_ that developed
    the first nuclear weapons. He also worked on rocket propulsion using nuclear
    pulses, and developed the _Monte Carlo method_ – and important concept in
    statistics.

venn:
  name: Venn
  bio: __John Venn__ (1834 – 1923) was an English mathematician and philosopher
    who introduced the _Venn diagram_ used in set theory and probability. He
    taught at Cambridge University and was a Fellow of the Royal Society in
    London.

viete:
  born: 1540
  died: 1603
  name: Viète
  bio: |
    __François Viète__ (1540 – 1603) was a French mathematician, lawyer, and
    advisor to Kings Henry III and IV of France. He made significant advances
    in Algebra, and first introduced the use of letters to represent variables.

    Viète discovered the connection between the roots and coefficients of a
    polynomial, called _Viète's formula_. He also wrote books about geometry
    and trigonometry, including calculating _π_ to 10 decimal places using a
    polygon with 393216 sides.

wallis:
  born: 1616
  died: 1703
  name: Wallis
  bio: The English mathematician __John Wallis__ (1616 – 1703) contributed to
    the development of calculus, invented the number line and the symbol ∞ for
    infinity, and served as chief cryptographer for Parliament and the royal
    court.

wiles:
  born: 1953
  died: 2020
  name: Wiles
  bio: |
    The British mathematician Sir __Andrew Wiles__ (born 1953) is best known for
    proving Fermat’s Last Theorem, which, until then, was one of the most famous
    unsolved problems in mathematics.

    In 1637, Pierre de Fermat, wrote in the margin of a textbook that he had a
    wonderful proof that the equation `a^n + b^n = c^n` has no integer
    solutions for `n > 2`. Unfortunately, no one was able to find a proof –
    until Wiles, some 400 years later.

    Wiles had been fascinated by the problem since the age of 10, and spent
    seven years working on it in solitude. He announced his solution in 1993,
    although a small gap in his argument took two more years to fix.

    He was too old to receive the _Fields medal_, the highest award in
    mathematics, which has an age limit of 40. Instead, Wiles was awarded a
    special silver plaque for his work.
